4. Activate your conda environment, navigate to the folder where the notebook is located and type "jupyter notebook"
5. Place the BBC dataset csv files in a folder called "learn-ai-bbc"
6. Keep "plotmat.py" in the same folder as the notebook
7. Open the notebook and just sequentially run all the sections.
